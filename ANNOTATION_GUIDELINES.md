## Annotation Guidelines

### Folder Structure / File names

+-- images

+-- truth

"images" contains the image files in png format in the form "sample_name_x.(png|jpg|jpeg)"

"truth" contains the ground truth files in .txt format in the form "sample_name_x.txt", should contain the text contained in the image.

The images should be a mix of scanned/photographed documents.

The images and their corresponding ground truth should have the same base name (without the extension).

Source pdf for the images should be as varied as possible in terms of font type / size, background color, content layout and subject (math, languages ...)
